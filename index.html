				<p>AJ - After forming our group and reviewing everyone’s profiles, it was good to see that we had a good mix of personalities. There seems to be a healthy balance of introverted and extroverted personas which can be ideal for communicating. As an introverted personality, listening to others makes me feel comfortable in group settings. I typically let others talk first before thinking about my response and adding my feedback or opinion. I do feel that I am more introverted with certain types of communication, I often prefer to text than call, type than meet. This will definitely be a learning curve and something to overcome, but extremely beneficial for future projects and careers. Lastly, as my test results reflect, I like to think, a lot. I think this can be useful to my group as I could potentially add in different perspectives to an idea. The downside however is that thinking can turn into dwelling and spending to much time on a particular area to try achieving the perfect result. </p>

				<h2>Blockchain</h2>
				<p>Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and often public digital ledger. It is used to keep records of transactions between networks or peer to peer. The primary use of Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger for Cryptocurrencies. For every transaction using Blockchain Technology a record or a block is formed. Both parties get a full audited transaction history that cannot be altered, which are linked or chained together. This gives the end buyer the full history and information from the first initial transaction that may have happened from 3 owners ago. With the transparency and shared ledgers of transactions it is very hard and time consuming to hack or disrupt the Blockchain. If you have 10 transactions in a Blockchain and 1 gets altered to change the amount of Bitcoin you have the algorithm will see that 1 block has a different ledger amount compared to the other 9 meaning it will change that 1 block to copy the consensus. Whereas if 6 out of the 10 blocks have the same information and 4 are different then the 4 will be changed to mimic the other 6. Basically if someone was to alter it for malicious means they would need to change at least 51% of the blocks in the chain to gain the majority for the algorithm to change it. Which would be very time consuming and costly as each transaction is also date and time stamped to help combat this.
				</p><p>The types of Blockchain are usually broken into 3 subheadings:
				</p><p><ol><li>Permissioned or private Blockchain.</li>
				<li>2-Permissionless or public Blockchain.</li>
				<li>3-Hybrid or consortium Blockchain.</li></ol>
				</p><p>The permission or private Blockchain is a small scale version of the public one. Generally used in a business for Supply chain management, asset ownership or internal voting. Private Blockchain transactions are faster due to the smaller amount of nodes that need to be verified during a transaction. The fewer nodes on a Blockchain also increase the security issues with fewer sources of information it can be easily altered but usually require each node to be approved before joining the Blockchain.
				</p><p>Public Blockchain is as the name would suggest, open to anyone that wishes to join the network and establish a node. It is decentralized meaning no single organization controls the Blockchain. Public Blockchains being open nature they should be secured with cryptography and a proof of work consensus system. Generally used for Cryptocurrencies a new block cannot be added to the chain without the node or transaction being confirmed with the consensus system, making forging transactions near impossible. 
				</p><p>Thirdly we have a Hybrid Blockchain which is a mix of both public and private. The architecture of this Blockchain is entirely customizable and members who use this can decide on which transactions are available to everyone or who can access the Blockchain. Being controlled by a smaller peer group this can pose some risks of dishonest people but with the Immutability and security that each transaction has it makes it very hard.
				</p>

				<h2>Cryptocurrency</h2>
				<p>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency which can be used as a form of payment instead of real dollars, euros, pounds etc., and created by using encryption algorithms. They use the Blockchain technology your digital wallet that stores your crypto coins acts as a virtual account system for you as well as the value of the coin.
				</p><p>It all started with the Bitcoin but has branched into thousands of other different coins and different versions. 
				</p><p>The next couple of years will be interesting regarding what is next for Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency. Smart contracts will come into play with conditions that can be self-executed and self-enforcing. Supply chain uses are also a step forward for the Blockchain technology with each step of the way from say the farm to consumer being recorded and tracked via the Blockchain will keep everyone accountable on damages or health violations that can arise. 

				</p><p>Blockchain Technology can impact various aspects of our lives from Finance and banking to online security as well as supply chain management. 
				</p><p>The banking sector are working on adapting Blockchain Technology to allow the exchanging of money to become more efficient, secure and faster. 
				</p><p>Some say the future of Blockchain technology can replace the bank ideology all together. Without any need for a centralized governing entity what would we need them for? An example is with humanitarian workers in the middle of war torn African countries many have no access to banks and need to be paid in cash. Workers need to hike through remote jungles with bags full of cash to pay their workers at the risk of theft, kidnapping or death. With Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies these issues can be alleviated. 
				</p><p>Cybersecurity could benefit as well with having a decentralized system rather than a centralized server with data loss, corruption and human error all factors that can be wiped out with the Blockchain technology. Instead of a hacker needing to infiltrate one system or server they would need to hit 51% of the Blockchain system at the exact time to cause any disruption.
				</p><p>Healthcare could see passing of information quicker and more secure from GP’s to hospitals and specialists.
				</p><p>Government voting could be submitted in real time via the Blockchain system with more security and efficiency.
				</p><p>The future is endless for this technology, some sectors could be made redundant such as brokers or banking transfer agents with no need to transfer money and then the bank needing to authorise this then submit it to the other client’s bank and get their approval and so on.




				</p><p>In daily life this will be affected hugely among various areas. Social media platforms will be more secure and safe from theft with the very difficult task of hacking your account it will deter people. You will have the right to voice your opinion without the risk of retaliation from the centralized company’s views or ideologies. Your data is owned and published by you and not something for the company to sell off to the highest bidder. 
				</p><p>Safety and security will be a big part with the future of Blockchain, people will be at ease more knowing their usernames and passwords are stored on encrypted Blockchain networks rather than one server that houses hundreds of millions of others usernames and passwords making it the target for would be thieves. 
				</p><p>The main differences Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies will bring is peace of mind and trust in the system rather than an entity like a bank or the government. Crypto currency will become more and more prevalent as people will want to shy away from government regulations. Crypto being decentralized is not subject to inflation making it a more stable form of value rather than traditional currency.

				<h2>Natural Language Processing and Chatterbots.<h2>

				<h3>What does it do?</h3>
				<p><strong>Natural language Processing</strong></p>
				<p>The term Natural Language Processing or NLP is a broad definition used to describe the translation of languages. In the IT industry, natural language processing refers to a computer science that is used to examine human language and speech that can be converted into computing languages. This converted language can then be used to assist and further develop areas of artificial intelligence (AI), management and distribution of complex data, online monitoring, and filtration systems.</p>
				<p>There are five key types of analysis used to handle and process languages:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Tokenization analysis</li>
					<li>Lexical analysis</li>
					<li>Syntactic analysis</li>
					<li>Semantic analysis</li>
					<li>Pragmatic analysis</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Tokenization and Lexical analysis are used to collect language and convert them into characters into a sequence of lexical tokens (‘What is Tokenization in NLP – Lexalytics’ 2021), these tokens are used to teach machines about words and provide a foundation to work on (‘What is Tokenization in NLP – Lexalytics’ 2021).</p>
				<p>Syntactic analysis operates on understanding the logical composition of a sentence or text (‘Syntactic analysis’ n.d.) whereas semantic analysis uses interpretation to process sentences and pull meaning from sentences and texts (‘Semantic Analysis, Explained’ 2020). Both forms of analysis rely heavily on the use of correct grammar to be effective. </p>
				<p>Finally, pragmatic analysis relies on external word knowledge to interpret a sentence’s meaning and reiterate typically in a more complete, condensed form of communication (‘Pragmatic Analysis | Python Natural language Processing’ n.d.).</p>
				<p>Each method of analysis can be crucial depending how they are implemented and what type of processing they will be handling. As an example, tokenization and lexical analysis could be used as tools to build a foundation of keywords to target in search engines or translation software whereas syntactic, semantic and pragmatic may be utilized in chat bots that provide assistance and guidance.</p>
				<p><strong>Chatterbots</strong></p>
				<p>Chatbots or chatterbots are software that run in the form of an application used online to service communication and interaction. These applications work by processing, analysing and translating voice or text and generating a response based on the users’ requests. Chatterbots can be thought as an extension of natural language processing, where NLP provides the framework to translate the information, chatterbots are the application used to implement it online.</p>
				<p>Currently, chatterbots are used to navigate conversation and handle low complexity tasks. The most common type of chatbots are assistance-based applications, which are typically the first point of contact for users that offer guidance and help with common pain points. The technology now allows chatbots to handle the initial contact as they typically offer up pre-generated conversation that users can interact with. This is where the software relies on the use of keywords in order to continue or navigate the conversation. As the interaction takes on more complexity, for example, where users are now asking questions or responding with sentences, the application is relying on analysing the logic and understanding of text or voice to continue the interaction. Most chatbots now are simply used as a tool to start a conversation, find a user’s paint point and connect them with a person. This is simply because the technology isn’t available for chatterbots to be able to handle the complexity of a conversation, yet. This is still generally reserved for humans who can process this information quicker, more effectivity and most importantly improvised.</p>
				<p>AI and NLP will be the biggest contributing factors in seeing how chatterbots will develop. As these types of analysis and database tools continue to improve, chatterbot applications will also be able to improve. Chatterbots have proven to be critical tools used by businesses that focus heavily on customer service and experience, so investment will no doubt be possible in making these tools more effective. In future developments, chatterbots may be able to handle more complex styles of interaction or entire conversations. I can see the development of chatterbots taking a similar pathway to how voice recognition software in smart phone and home devices has. The overall product can handle more complex processes but is still quite clunky compared to the control of a human.</p>
				
				<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>

				<p>Natural language processing and chatterbot applications will only continue to improve as technology continues to advance. One area that I can see drastically changing is the complexity and depth chatterbot communication will be able to provide to consumers. Chatterbots now, can only carry out certain aspects of customer service and interaction. Typically, they will guide a user towards the assistance or action they require before the task is passed on to a human that can handle the more challenging level of interaction. Further development of analysis tools in the future could see a depth of AI processing that let’s chatterbot applications manage an entire complex interaction independently. A chatterbot that could manage all aspects of a conversation, from answering numerous questions, providing product or technical information, and most importantly, handle complaints, could put immense pressure on the role of support staff. The current job has already seen a reduction in roles and responsibilities as chatterbots usually manage the initial interaction. As AI processing continues to develop, chatterbots could provide personal 24/7 assistance, end to end communication, at a fraction of the cost. This will make it increasingly difficult for business trying to compete with AI, having to choose between having a real person behind a computer or minimising costs and maximising profits. AI software won’t require a salary which will lead to a reduction or redundancy of the human support role.</p>
				
				<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>

				<p>I imagine this could have a massive impact on the way we communicate and interact in an online space, which will almost certainly expand into other areas like telephone calls, voice to text, and smart home appliances. I believe it would be a positive experience to have better NLP, chatterbot and AI processing systems integrated into high use, everyday items and provide better overall customer service and convenience. </p>
				<p>Overall, dealing with businesses in an online space and on a telephone would be vastly different if there were chatterbot or voice recognition software in place that could manage an entire conversation. Personally, when I do have an issue online, I use chatbots for assistance which can be frustrating as they can only narrow down a topic I need to discuss with a real person, or they require my details so that someone can make contact later to discuss the issue. It would be extremely beneficial to be able to resolve an issue when it arises. </p>
				<p>Furthermore, I can also see voice to text functions being vastly different as well. The function is a handy tool to have especially for searching long terms on google or replying to messages. However, these functions currently can be quite clunky and often misinterpret words and sentences incorrectly. With advanced software and analysis tools increasing the richness of AI databases, this could mean that human voice is understood much better. This would ultimately reduce how much I would have to check grammatical or interpretation errors and make the software more fluid and seamless. </p>
				<p>I can see family and friends sharing a similar positive experience as well. The biggest issue I hear from older members of family is how frustrating it is to not be able to speak to a real person. If chatbots and AI processing can advance to the point where it is able to replicate a conversation with the same personality as real individual, I can see their experiences being enriched as well.</p>

				<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
				<p>Cybersecurity is the process of protecting computer systems, networks, devices and programs from all sorts of cyber-attacks (Tunggal 2022). Recently the Australian media has made cyber security the center of everyone’s attention. With recent cyber-attacks on Optus and Medibank private it has exposed the increasingly sophisticated and always evolving danger to hackers accessing and exposing our data. Attackers are always evolving new methods that are generally powered by social engineering and artificial intelligence compared to the once seen traditional data breach we were used to. As our world becomes increasingly reliant on technology as a regular part of life so do we see the development of new security programs such as cloud security solutions, multi-factor authentication and unauthorized access protocols to stay ahead of malware (Tunggal 2022). Risk of cyber-attacks is forever increasing with our ever-growing global connectivity and use of cloud storage devices. As the development of this technology is becoming complicated, as are the cyber thieves with the creation of new malware and cyber threats. </p>

				<p>It is now common for most workplace to include cyber security training as part of a new employee’s introduction period. Staff need to be educated about common cyber threats like social engineering scams, phishing, ransomware and other malware programs designed to steal intellectual property and personal data (Tunggal 2022). Cybersecurity can be broken down into four main areas of concentration. These areas are deterrence, detection, prevention and response. Deterrence can use both physical and online strategies to minimize the risk of security breach (Openpath 2022). Deterrence can start as simple as a fence, video surveillance, access gates and authorized only entries to a build. Online deterrence takes the form of passwords, multi factor authorization and captcha technology. Detection may come in the form of physical door alarms, inappropriate computer behavior or uncommon network log in locations. Prevention is seen as a way of slowing down breaches or intrusion. Online this can take the form of multiple layers of access control, data encryption, multi-factor authentication (Openpath 2022). Security breach have become a common part of the cyber world. An appropriate response to this situation is a crucial part of cyber security. Security technology products including building lockdowns, remote access and controls, and the ability to send live video feeds to first responders are all great examples of this component (Openpath 2022).</p>

				<p>Covid 19 defiantly changed the world we live in. Before 2020 work from home was unheard of and work remotely was seen as a dream job. Since the global pandemic gripped the world, it is estimate that over 35 million American now work from home or remotely (WEF 2020). This means the number of networks and devices that link home computing to corporate platforms has grown dramatically. HP reports that global cyber-attacks are on the rise by 238% since the biggening of the pandemic (WEF 2020). Companies are having to manage these risks by increased security via virtual private networks, continuous password updates, multi factor authorization and increased cybersecurity/ IT employment. As cybercriminals are consistently developing new schemes and programs, organizations are having to invest and develop in new innovated technologies to try to stay ahead of the crime. Real-time data monitoring is a way companies are continuously updating systems and data that is used to protect the organization from cyber criminals (WEF 2020).</p>
				<p>Security professionals can then act on data breaches quickly and avoid the risk of loss. With this data collection organizations can track information over long periods which helps to identify and predict behaviors and anomalies that occur. This method is known as trend monitoring (WEF 2020). New and developing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Quantum computing are starting to be used by attackers. There is growing evidence that AI could start being used as defensive tools against attacks (WEF 2020). AI could be the future of cybersecurity, however will this put millions of cyber security experts out of work? Quantum computing has been a powerful way to solve some classical mathematical problems in the past (WEF 2020).  If used correctly could quantum computing be used to stay steps ahead of the programs created by cyber criminals. </p>

				<p>In 2021 the global cyber security market was valued at approximately USD 139 billion dollars (Fortune business insights 2022). Moving forward the market is only expected to grow exponentially. Estimates are expecting the industry to double over the next 10 years to a value of USD 375 billion dollars (Fortune business insights 2022). Over the last two years the cybersecurity industry as seen dramatic increase in job availability. With the ever-growing demand for security solutions, position in the cyber security industry have risen by 7.7% since the beginning of the global pandemic (Fortune business insights 2022).  There is already a growing global shortage of cybersecurity specialists. The ever-increasing need for technology to be in our daily lives and make everything we do easier has driven companies to take up a larger online presence. The negative effects of this have been the increase of criminal activity regarding fraud, theft and data breaches. Moving forward companies of all sizes will be investing more time and money into safely securing their online assets. This will only add to the position and jobs available in the cyber security industry. With opportunities becoming increasing available a recent report from ISACA’s State of Cybersecurity found that 60% of companies were now reporting difficulties retaining cybersecurity professionals (Comptia 2022).</p>

				<p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2.1 million Australians or approximately 11 percent of the population have experienced at least one type of personal fraud in the last 2 years. That is 1 in 9 Australians (abs 2022).  How will it affect you? Most likely someone in your direct family has been affected by fraud recently.  Today almost everyone in our society is connected to the internet either by our smartphones, laptops, game systems or smart watches. Whether we are making purchases via online shopping, completing internet banking via an app or simply just storing bank account details, we are all vulnerable to cyberthreats. Cybersecurity is becoming even more important to everyone’s daily life as it protects data from theft and damage. All our devices have multitudes of sensitive information including personal identifiable information, protected health information, intellectual property, data, and government information (Tunggal 2022). Without an antivirus protection service in place our devices cannot defend themselves against malware and cybercriminals. Cyberattacks are attempts to access our devices information that can lead to a loss of money and personal information (Readgov 2022). In our society today Wi-Fi is everywhere and during our daily life we may connect to unprotected free Wi-Fi services multi times a day. Unfortunately, it is a common occurrence to have our financial information stolen and our credit card compromised by fraudulent activities. These days cyber criminals are no longer just targeting large companies but more constantly targeting individuals with ransomware that seeks personal and financial information. They may take smaller amounts of money from credit cards and bank accounts (Readgov 2022). </p>

				<p>Cybersecurity more than ever needs to become everyone’s personal responsibility no different to locking your car while inside the shops or home while your away on holiday. The recent increase of data breaches mean that cybersecurity is no longer just important for big business and regulated industries, but now more than ever small business and private citizens are at risk of suffering irrecoverable reputational damage following data breaches (Upguard 2022).</p>

				<h2>Developments in Machine Learning<h2>
				<h3>What does it do?</h3>
				<p><strong>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</strong></p>
				<p>Machine Learning is defined as  "the technique that improves system performance by learning from experience via computational methods," (Zhou, 2021). It literally enables machines to learn from data and thus acquire knowledge.  This is accomplished by making "learning algorithms" or experiences that can be used to predict outcomes or "models" (Zhou, 2021). With the myriad of data now available worldwide, it is imperative that a system is able to collect, manage, analyse and make sense of all this information and how it can be applied in the real world.  </p>
				<p>Data analysis is at the heart of machine learning. According to Baloglu, Ratifi and Nazha (2022), "when there are a large number of variables, or their relation to the output variable is too complex, or non-linear to be described by linear lines, or even there is no obvious output variable to be predicted in the dataset,... a different approach is needed. This alternative strategy is called ML."  It is revolutionary as “machine learning,..approaches problems as a doctor progressing through residency might: by learning rules from data,.. [it can handle] enormous numbers of predictors — sometimes, remarkably, more predictors than observations — and combining them in nonlinear and highly interactive ways. This capacity allows us to use new kinds of data, whose sheer volume or complexity would previously have made analyzing them unimaginable.” (Obermeyer & Emanuel, 2016).  In a manner of speaking, it is like The Terminator wherein the machine stores different outcomes or possibilities based on experience/data input and makes calculated decisions based on these experiences. With machine learning, though, millions of variables are stored and calculated. </p>
				

				<p><strong>What can be done now?</strong></p> 

				<p>The applications for this technology are numerous and wide in scope.  For example, data collected from satellites are used for meteorological, energy and environmental research; from a business perspective, machine learning can be used for sales and investment analysis, optimising logistics and operations research ((Johra, Verma and Paul, 2020); from a lay person point-of-view, the humble “Google search” function is a product of extensive data analysis through machine learning - mapping associations and patterns generate what we have now regarded as a common search by keyword, or by photo (Zhou, 2021).  Communications (including speech recognition), software engineering; architecture (Johra, Verma and Paul, 2020); and bioinformatics (which includes genetics and cancer research), (Baloglu, Ratifi and Nazha, 2022)and robotics are among the applications of ML. </p>

				<p>Some examples of specific machine learning successes are:<br/> 

				<ul>
					<li>In the medical field, machine learning has been successfully applied in the fields of ophthalmology and radiology. "For example, in ophthalmology the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, and in radiology the diagnosis of stroke or cancers from digital images is promising." (Baloglu, Ratifi and Nazha, 2022).  The digital pixels in radiographs are now bits of data that are analysed as individual variables resulting in clusters that allow clinicians to learn “contours of fracture lines, parenchymal opacities, and more,” (Obermeyer & Emanuel, 2016), and covid-19 detection</li> 
					<li>for the common person, we see an increase in the use of "Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP)"   e.g. facial recognition in  smartphones, Google translate, self-driving cars, conversational AIs such as Alexa, Siri, Google</li>
					<li>in the justice system, ML plays a big part in the implementation of cybersecurity</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</strong></p> 

				<p>Increased automation is a direct effect of increased reliance on machine learning.</p> 

				<p>The medical field, for example,  is expecting to.expand the applications of ML into the subspecialties of paediatrics, (Baloglu, Ratifi and Nazha, 2022).  Machine learning will allow improved prognosis, reduce human error by allowing the machine to interpret images, and improve diagnostic accuracy (Obenmeyer & Emanuel, 2016)</p>

				<p>Analysis of non-linear big data such as in ecosystem service research (Scowen and Athanasiadis, 2021)</p>

				<p>In economics, "[the] staggering volumes of digital information relevant to measuring and understanding the economy are generated each second by an increasing array of devices that monitor transactions and business processes as well as track the activities of workers and consumers." This means that the time is ripe for machine learning to be incorporated into economic statistics (Abraham, Jarmin, Moyer, & Shapiro, M. D., 2022).</p>

				<p>Automated machine learning (see below) and further use of augmented reality are futuristic developments.  </p>

				<p><strong>What technological or other developments make this possible?  </strong></p>

				<p>The digitisation of raw data over the years has paved the way for this information to be readily available for mining and analyses.  We now have a "staggering volume of information",  (Abraham, Jarmin, Moyer, & Shapiro, M. D., 2022). Machine learning would have been ineffective had it not been for the existence of big data. </p>

				<p>Hinton's 2006 Deep Learning theory paved the way for the idea that machines can learn  image patterns.</p>

				<p>Deep neural networks such as the one developed by Meta allowed the processing of larger data </p>


				<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>


				<p><strong>What is the potential impact of this development? </strong></p>

				<p>The surge in ML's popularity across various fields has given rise to the development of Automated Machine Learning (autoML). Simply put, it's machine learning without the  or with limited interference from a human engineer.    An application or software that can be installed and be expected to generate predictions with minimal intervention.  According to Hutter, Kotthiff, and Vanschoren (2019), "this is particularly true in the booming field of deep learning, where human engineers need to select the right neural architectures, training procedures, regularization methods, and hyperparameters of all of these components in order to make their networks do what they are supposed to do with sufficient performance." </p>

				<p>However, it should be noted that the increasing complexities of machine learning, particularly deep learning, while fascinating and far-reaching in its application, is still susceptible to bias. Zhou (2021) has enumerated the following deficiencies in machine learning: it requires an extensive amount of data which in itself can be expensive to acquire or in some cases infeasible; if the environment changes, the model may become useless; trained models are “blackboxes”. ML models are so complex that it is not possible to exactly understand and explain how the ML model produced its output. Resulting in bias (Baloglu, Ratifi and Nazha, 2022).  </p>

				<p>Therefore, improved validation techniques i.e. neutrosophic logic (Varona, Lizama-Mue, & Suárez, 2021), </p>

				<p><strong>What is likely to change?  </strong></p>

				<p>Machine learning will continue to displace human intervention in fields requiring data analysis.  </p> 

				<p>Faster processing and more accurate data analysis will be imminent as scientists endeavour to develop more efficient algorithms that can minimise or identify biased outcomes.</p>

				<p><strong>Which people will be most affected and how? </strong></p>

				<p>Review of existing  machine learning literature points to the following industries currently benefiting from sophisticated machine learning technology:<br>
					<ol>
						<li>Medicine and health care		</li>
						<li>IT		</li>
						<li>Business and finance		</li>
						<li>Environmental Science		</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<p>From an end user perspective, machine learning will mostly impact us (i.e. patients, consumers). </p>

				<p><strong>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?  </strong></p> 

				<p>Potentially, continued ML developments will replace its human counterparts in specific jobs such as construction work, medical technologists, factory work, face-to-face retailing such as banking, shopping and hospitality (as these are replaced by self serve kiosks).</p>

				<h3>How will this affect you?</h3> 
				<p><strong>In your daily life, how will this affect you?  </strong></p>

				<p>As a millenial, the advent of machine learning has been 
				very helpful because in this day and age we have so much new information that was not there before.  Machine learning enables us to filter out what is necessary and what is unnecessary for each individual. For example, as an IT student, my current google results and social media feeds are related to what I am studying, which saves a lot of time and effort. </p>

				<p>It also enables me to generate results quickly and at my fingertips. Productivity is increased. The access to resources has become global and instant.</p>  

				<p>Robotics (which is an application of machine learning) is now, in a manner of speaking, child's play as exemplified by the increase in STEM toys even in places such as Kmart.</p> 

				<p><strong>What will be different for you? </strong></p> 

				<p>Research as we know it has been extended to include machine computation as necessary rather than optional. Where data gathering was limited to a random sample of 30 or so, researchers now have access to billions of raw data. Data mining and deep learning are occupational realities.  As a student, I need to be knowledgeable in basic data science to be able to progress in any profession.  It is a new language to be acquired and applied in everyday living. </p>


				<p><strong>How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </strong></p>

				<p>The older members of my family are now faced with the reality that computer technology and artificial intelligence are here to stay.  Adjusting their lifestyle to accommodate this new way of doing things is a  learning curve that they are growing into.  Simple examples are online banking, virtual assistants, streaming and internet TV, Alexa and Google Home.  </p>
